      <h2>The Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Stained glass has captivated humanity for centuries—adorning cathedrals, 
        illuminating homes, and transforming ordinary light into something magical. 
        At CMB Glass & Stone, we continue this timeless tradition, creating 
        contemporary pieces that honor classical techniques while embracing modern design.
      </p>

      <h2>The Craft</h2>
      <p>
        Each piece begins with careful planning and design. We work closely with our 
        clients to understand their vision, space, and aesthetic preferences. From there, 
        the real magic begins:
      </p>

      <ul class="craft-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Design & Pattern Making</strong> — Every piece starts as a sketch, 
          refined until it perfectly captures the intended vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glass Selection</strong> — We source high-quality art glass from 
          around the world, choosing colors and textures that will bring each design to life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cutting & Shaping</strong> — Each piece of glass is carefully cut 
          and ground to fit perfectly within the design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assembly</strong> — Using traditional copper foil or lead came 
          techniques, each piece is assembled and soldered with precision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Finishing</strong> — The completed piece is cleaned, polished, 
          and prepared for installation or display.
        </li>
      </ul>
